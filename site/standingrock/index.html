        <p><span class="drop">M</span>y name is Alyssa Mae. I’m a 22-year-old senior journalism major at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.</p><p>I grew up in Yutan, Nebraska, a community of 1,200 mostly white people wedged between Wahoo and Omaha, a thoroughly rural enclave where I graduated in a senior class of 36 students. </p><p>In short, I’m a small-town Nebraskan girl. </p><p>My involvement in the fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline wasn’t anything I could have predicted. In fact, it fell into my lap rather unexpectedly.</p><p>NoDAPL first appeared in the form of Facebook posts, then rapidly and inadvertently weaved itself into nearly every aspect of my life. It was discussed in my classes. It sneaked its way into my conversations. It leaked into my personal life. </p><p>I couldn’t ignore it anymore. History was playing out right in front of my eyes, and I was doing nothing about it. </p><p>So I found a group of five like-minded environmentalists, and soon the date was set. </p><p>I was going to Standing Rock – a Sioux reservation in North Dakota where thousands had gathered to prevent an oil pipeline from being built beneath the reservation’s water supply and its sacred lands.</p>

        <p>It’s 1 a.m. as we pull into the gates of Oceti Sakowin, the Council of Seven Fires. I stare up at the endless flags lining the edge of the huge, sprawling camp, their bright colors cracking and popping in the strong North Dakota winds. The idea that each of these flags represents a different Indian nation or group that has come to stand in solidarity with the “water protectors” seems amazing. There has to be more than 200.</p><p>Oceti Sakwoin is enormous. Larger than I ever imagined. A small city nestled in a valley of grassy hills.  Tents, cars and tipis are everywhere, jumbled up and strewn about like the aftermath of a tornado.</p>

        <p>I think that only 11 hours ago I was walking the campus sidewalks of Lincoln, Nebraska 604 miles south.</p><p>Suddenly, a beam of light splits the darkness, shining directly into our electric blue SUV. Two Native men peer inside, their breath visible in the late-October air. </p><p>“Are you new campers?” </p><p>We nod. In the silence, I hear my heart beating too loud. I hadn’t read anything about camp security. Do they just allow anyone in? </p><p>The Native man’s face crinkles into a smile. He extends his hand and introduces himself and the man beside him.  They welcome us, asking our names and where we came from.</p>

        <p>They seem genuinely grateful, as though a bunch of random scruffy Nebraska college students are exactly who they needed to join their ranks.  I look around at the four other students in the car, and I can see they look as perplexed as I am about the warm welcome.</p><p>They bless our car with the smoke from burning sage and enthusiastically wave us in, telling us to set up camp wherever we wish. </p><p>“Welcome home,” one of the men calls out.</p><p>Something shifts inside me, but I can’t pinpoint exactly what. </p><p>Home.

        <p>Life in the camp is radically different than home. </p><p>It’s morning and I wake to the sound of horses neighing, a campfire crackling and the pounding of distant drums. I bundle up in three layers of jackets and escape from my tent only to realize we’ve been surrounded by horses. Five of them, only about 10 feet away, grazing lazily on the field of dry prairie grasses, their silhouettes highlighted by the golden light of the rising sun.</p>

It’s chaotic and foreign and my senses are on overdrive. </p><p>I realize as I start work at the kitchen that this place seems to move like a high-functioning colony of ants. Volunteers unload truckloads of donations and distribute them throughout the camp. Cooks boil giant cast-iron caldrons of coffee over burning coals. Herbalists mix concoctions of hot pine needle tea. A group of young men lug donated plywood and set to work winterizing the camp.</p>

        <p>It isn’t until the sun has set and I’m basking in the glow of the sacred fire with a plate of fry bread and buffalo meat that I get a glimpse of what it is.</p><p>The Natives shift from foot to foot, hopping up and down to each hit of the drum as a group of young men sing in unison. The dancers’ linked arms sway back and forth as they circle the elders sitting in the center wearing feathered headdresses.</p><p>And before long, I realize they’re giving me the answer I’ve been struggling with all day. </p><p>There’s a sense of community here unlike anything I’ve experienced. It’s this strange codependence. Outside of Oceti Sakowin, dependence often has negative implications. </p><p>But the people standing around me are dependent on one another, and they are perfectly okay with it. They trust each other. They trust that their neighbor has their best interest in mind. They trust that the cooks will serve them food, or the medics will heal their wounds – not because money is being exchanged, but because there’s an understanding between them: I’ll take care of you. You take care of me.</p>

        <p>The stars are all gone in Standing Rock.</p><p>Bright white floodlights now encircle the camp, enormous lights positioned on top of the surrounding hills by the Bismarck police. The beautiful starry night sky has been washed away. </p><p>I lean forward against the steering wheel, squinting out at the massive camp, one of the many in a long line of cars. The camp is larger than it was last time with a many new structures, including a huge heated dome. Overhead, I can hear a helicopter circling the camp, but for some reason its lights are off. I’m not an expert, but I’m pretty positive that’s illegal. </p><p>We don’t have tents this time. It’s far too cold now. We’ve resorted to sleeping in the car. We pull into the parking area, bundled into our layers of coats and follow the echo of drumbeats and song to the sacred fire.</p><p>The mood of the camp is somber. The night before, hundreds of camp dwellers were soaked with water cannons in subzero temperatures, shot with rubber bullets and strafed with tear gas. </p><p>A woman steps to the microphone, speaking on behalf of her sister who was shot in the eye by a beanbag and needs medical treatment. She asks for donations so she can get her sister home to the hospital.</p>

I give my little cousins piggyback rides around the house, and explain to my prying aunts that “Yes, I am still single.”</p><p>This year, it’s a little different: I find myself staring at the legal number scrawled across my forearm in black permanent marker. If I get arrested, this is my ticket out of jail. </p><p>Arrested on Thanksgiving. Wow – didn’t see that one coming. </p><p>I stare at the surreal scene around me: gas masks and goggles passed around, earplugs handed out, Natives and Non-Natives beginning to pray and sing, holding signs and burning sage.</p>

        <p>But mom was different. Every time I’d come back, she’d want to hear every detail. She always wished she could have been there, but her photography business got in the way. </p><p>Now I catch her eye and give her a reassuring smile. She’s handling the chaos better than I did. She’s a natural leader, and even though she’s new to the camp, people are looking to her for direction.</p><p>I wish I had more time with her here. I wish she could experience everything that I have. I want her to see this place like I do. But there’s so many people, it is not the same camp.</p><p>We only have a few hours before we start the drive home. Tomorrow the camp is supposed to be cleared out, but that’s not happening. </p><p>Whatever tomorrow brings, it’ll change the future of this camp forever.</p><p>And I’m sad I won’t be a part of it.</p>

        <p>My mother is my rock. </p><p>I use her remarkable intuition as my moral compass, guiding me through whatever tough spots I find myself in. It’s part of the reason I was so eager to take her to Standing Rock. I wanted to see if maybe I was missing something. I was dealing with something so controversial and foreign to me. It would be easy to get lost in my own enthusiasm. </p><p>Turns out I was right. </p><p>On our way home, as the sun’s warm light begins to fade into darkness, my mom points out something I think I‘ve always instinctively felt, but never really consciously recognized.</p>

        <p>She says we come from a society that’s missing a lot of connections. We’ve lost our connection to the earth. We’ve lost our connections to our culture. We’ve lost our connection to each other. </p><p>We are so caught up in technology, consumerism and status, we forget the importance of these connections. </p><p>We forget until someone reminds us of what we are missing. </p><p>But the Native Americans have clung to their connections. Even after we’ve tried to forcedly remove them from their land, their culture and themselves, they’ve held strong. </p><p>Standing Rock is one of the few times in history that Native Americans have allowed so many outsiders a glimpse into their world. One of the few times we are able to watch their traditional dances and listen to their prayers and songs. That we are able to experience their love for people instead of things. That we are able to work together in a community that lives with the earth instead of against it. </p><p>And it’s waking us up to connections we’ve lost. </p><p>But my mother also says it’s important to recognize the difference between learning from Native Americans and trying to be Native Americans. </p><p>We are so starved for these connections that it’s tempting to try to cling to their cultures and beliefs like they are our own. But they aren’t. </p><p>They belong to the Native Americans. We can’t take them. </p><p>What we can do, instead, is fix our own culture. We can use the language we’ve learned in Oceti Sakowin and adopt it into our own. We can relearn our own priorities, get back in touch with out own communities and reconnect with our own roots. </p><p>As a visitor to Standing Rock, I have been given a gift. I have been blessed with the opportunity to reopen the eyes of the people around me. Now it’s up to me to choose what I want to do with this knowledge.</p><p>I can’t wait to get started.</p>
